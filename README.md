# PythonQuiz-Tkinter
The following represents a folder that consists of a main python file and 7 quiz files. Each of the 7 quiz files contains a quiz for its own topic. The various topics are : Around the World, Sports, Flora and Fauna, Current Affairs, Science and Technology, Human Body, and Name the Singer. In the main file we use tkinter to represent each of the quiz topics offered as a button and once the topic is selected, it imports the specific module and runs the quiz.
